# Constraints

- C-001: Existing fixed-point/decimal monetary and quantity core stays; do not introduce double arithmetic (source: legacy ADR-001/constraints)
- C-002: SQLite/Drift schema changes require versioned migration and transaction safety (source: legacy C-011)
- C-003: Offline-first, no account/cloud sync, and existing Android-first release setup remain (source: legacy C-002/C-030/C-033)
- C-004: Voice/OCR candidates never mutate data before user approval; native voice remains device-local (source: legacy C-003/C-005/ADR-006)
- C-005: Existing localization remains ARB/gen-l10n with all locale keys aligned (source: legacy ADR-003)
